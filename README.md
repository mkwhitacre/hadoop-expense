MapReduce Framework that gives you a receipt for the cost you incurred.

Inspired by [Dmitriy Ryaboy's](http://twitter.com/squarecog) presentation at [StrangeLoop 2012](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/scaling-scalability-evolving-twitter-analytics) and the concept of showing developers how much their work cost, the project hopes to calculate how much a MapReduce job really costs.  Giving developer's enough information to see the impact of their work could inspire the developers to make improvement and improve their performance.
